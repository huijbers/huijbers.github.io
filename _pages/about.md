##### About

I’m an Assistant Professor in Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) at Tilburg University and at the Jheronimus Academy for Data Science. My research is focused on the analysis of brain imaging data and measures of cognition. I’m especially interesting in neurological and psychiatric diseases, specifically AI-based methods for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease.
